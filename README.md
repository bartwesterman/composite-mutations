Oncogenic composite mutations can be predicted by co-mutations and their chromosomal location

Genetic heterogeneity in tumors can show a remarkable selectivity when two or more independent genetic events occur in the same gene.  This phenomenon, called composite mutation, points towards to a selective pressure that could cause therapy resistance to mutation-specific drugs. Since composite mutations have been described to occur in sub-clonal populations, they are not always captured through biopsy sampling. Here we provide a proof of concept to predict composite mutations to anticipate which patients might be at risk for sub-clonally driven therapy-resistance. We found that composite mutations occur in 5% of the patients, mostly affecting the PIK3CA, EGFR, BRAF and KRAS genes, which are common drug targets. Furthermore, we found that there is a strong relationship between the frequencies of composite mutations with commonly co-occurring mutations in a non-composite context (p-value 1.7E-10 or lower). We also found that co-mutations frequently occur on the same chromosome (p-values 4.0E-8) and cause a dependency on them (p-value 3.9E-5). The prediction model shows that prediction of compositive mutations is feasible (AUC 0.62, 0.81, 0.82 and 0.91 for EGFR/PIK3CA/KRAS and BRAF), which implicates that our model could help to assess the risk whether patients will develop therapy-resistance against targeted therapies.
